# Example multi-file persistence verification

This example demonstrates how environment variables can be set and accessed across multiple markdown files.

```bash docci-output-contains="abc123"
echo "Hello from file 2"
echo "Environment variable SOME_ENV is set to: $SOME_ENV (file2) which was set in file1"
```
